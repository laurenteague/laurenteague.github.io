Literally Lauren is a collection of original short stories. Many of them are written for children.  So if you read something that you think might appeal to a child you know, I would love it if you shared it with them. Or you can read them for yourself if you're in the mood for a quick read with a happy ending. Oh also, spoiler alert: all of these stories have happy endings.
